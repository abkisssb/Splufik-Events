# Splufik-Events

Project description:

This is an event planner web application where users can see catalogue of event types(birthday, baby shower,wedding, house warming etc), their pricing, create user accounts with their details and then choose from our basic or premium event plan. 
Once chosen, they can add more specifications; we will get it in the admin panel, generate their bill and then commence the event planning. This is somewhat similar to e-Commerce.
